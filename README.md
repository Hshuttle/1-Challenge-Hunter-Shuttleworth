# Challenge 1 HTML-Git-CSS Hunter Shuttleworth Submission

## User Story

AS A marketing agency</br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards</br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards</br>
WHEN I view the source code</br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements</br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements</br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning</br>
WHEN I view the image elements</br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes</br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes</br>
THEN they fall in sequential order</br>
WHEN I view the title element</br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Description

In this challenge, we were tasked to refractor starter code that was given to us. It involved relinking elements across CSS and HTML files to clean up the code and make it easier to read and follow all while keeping the visual appearance of the HTML file the same as when it was originally given.
